* AZ-301: Microsoft Azure Architect Design

OMG, I got this exam passed in the second attempt. I found this exam is much harder than AZ300, probably because I am quite familiar with Azure Portal so that I can gain more points from labs sections. 

In addition, there might be more than one options that can fit for the requirements, you need to select the most appropriate one.

In my first attempt, I used the same strategy as AZ300 - answer questions ASAP and not review to save time for Case Study. However, AZ301 is different, there is plenty of time to analyze the context and review your answers.

The most tricky type of question is True / False, you don't have chance to go to the previous question, there might be multiple True in one section. DON'T assume the first one always be False and the last one always be True.

      I quite like those videos from Mike Pfeiffer, I suppose it's easier to see demos than just descriptive talking.

Lastly, because I bought the [Certify with Confidence with Practice Test](https://au.mindhub.com/microsoft-certify-with-confidence-pt/p/MSFT-Cert-w-Confidence-PT), I took the advantage of "free" retake once.
