* AZ-203: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure - Resources
* [AZ-203: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure â€“ What I learned](/2019/05/02/az-203-2)

## Why AZ-203?

* I have been using Azure for a few years, but I mainly focus on PaaS and Storage (e.g. Azure SQL, Azure Search, CosmosDB, Azure Storage, etc). I would like to test how well I know Microsoft Azure.
* My goal is to get Azure Solution Architect certificate. In my opinion, Solution Architect must be a good developer.
* I planned to get 70-532 last year, but the certificate had been re-structured at the end of 2018, instead of getting another transitioning certificate, why not getting the most recent one.

## Lastly, practice, practice and practice

I have MSDN subscription, I deleted the Resource Group every night when I finished playing. And I have Azure CLI and Powershell installed on my Mac, and my favorite IDE - VSCode.
