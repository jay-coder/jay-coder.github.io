* AZ-300: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies
* [AZ-301: Microsoft Azure Architect Design](/2019/08/01/az-301/)


Fortunately I passed AZ-300 today, there were 5 sections including 2 labs on Azure portal. I spent almost 2.5 hours on the first 4 sections, when I started the last case study, less than 2 mins left, so I randomly picked the answers from dropdown.

A few dramas happened:
* I arrived at the test center 8AM for the 8:15AM test. However, nobody at the concierge until 8:15AM. About 5 people were waiting there, then the test was kicked off about 5 mins late.
* *One question appeared twice in the first section, I am sure I didn't click "previous" button by accident.
* When submitting, the labs' questions were counted as "not answered".
* When submitting, an exception dialog prompted "no internet connection".

I was very nervous about so many (19) "not answered" red cross icons, I thought I must fail the exam until I got me the "pass" paper.

I am still not sure how labs are calculated, I suppose they should be real time, but why they are marked as "not answered"?

In addition, there was a question exactly the same as my AZ203 test.

      I found Tim Warner's videos helped me a lot. When I viewed them, I couldn't fully understand them. But after playing around in Azure and reviewed the videos again, I understood most of them.

      I didn't buy this course, as I found it's quite similar to AZ-103 (70-533) which I bought earlier

Again practice, practice, practice......

Here are some labs that I'v done before the exam: 
* VNET Peering
* S2S VPN
* Sync between AAD Premium V2 and AD on Windows 2016 Data Centre
* Azure Site Recovery to backup / migrate VMs

  NOTE: I bought the <a href="https://au.mindhub.com/microsoft-certify-with-confidence-pt/p/MSFT-Cert-w-Confidence-PT">Certify with Confidence with Practice Test</a>, because it's a difficult exam and I didn't expect to pass it in the first attempt.
