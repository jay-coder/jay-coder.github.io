* AZ-203: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure – What I learned

AZ-203 is my first Microsoft certificate, how awkward? With more than 15 years of working experience on Microsoft stack. Well, this one needs broad knowledge of massive services in Azure, best practices and sometimes the most cost effective way for customers, rather than a particular technique e.g. ASP.NET or SQL Server.

The biggest mistake I made during the exam was that I thought the "Finish" button in each section was to terminate the whole exam. I asked the reception, she had no idea about it. That's why I spent too much time reviewing all the answers in section 2 and hesitated to click that button. When I jumped to the next section, I had less than 1 hour to complete all the other case studies. 

In the exam, be careful about the questions that you can't review especially True / False ones. It can be partially true, but according to the user story, it might not be appropriate.

Here are some knowledge that I didn't cover from either work or study:

* CDN - I was not quite understand its caching behavior and querystring caching behavior [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-caching-rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-caching-rules)

* Syncing offline data on mobile [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/data-cloud/sync/azure-mobile-apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/data-cloud/sync/azure-mobile-apps)

* Dockerfile - I used docker at work, but I was not so clear how ENTRYPOINT works. I only remember it can startup .NET Core App, I was not clear about the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT. [http://goinbigdata.com/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint/](http://goinbigdata.com/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint/)

* Always Encrypted ConnectionString with MSI enabled
  I was looking for <strong>Column Encryption Setting</strong>=enabled, however, it requires <strong>Integrated Security</strong>=true to skip User Id and Password

* Still not so sure about Cosmos DB consistency levels [https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels)

* Still not so sure about how to utilise monitor features from Application Insights [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-overview)


What you need to remember:
1. Azure CLI + Powershell, both scripts are needed in test
2. Security is very important e.g. Encrypt Rest, Always Encrypt, Dynamic Masking, Service Principal, MSI

Lastly, good luck!!!
