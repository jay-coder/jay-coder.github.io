## Why DevOps?

As a professional in software development industry, only experts in one particular technology or language is not enough. We have to understand the whole SDLC to be able to deliver the end to end solutions. DevOps is one of the key parts in the life cycle, it can improve the productivity of both development and operational teams, itâ€™s easier to adopt Agile methodology.

Nowadays, those popular topics e.g. DevSecOps, Infrastructure as Code, Docker, Kubernetes are also included in Azure DevOps, it becomes the one stop portal that can manage the source repositories, projects (epic, user story, task and bug), CI / CD pipelines, artifacts and test plans.

## Free Certification from Microsoft Build 2020
