## Why Security is important?

Cyber Security is one of the hottest topic all over the world. As an IT expert, how can we deliver a secure solution to: 
* Prevent data breach
* Protect personal information
* Identify malware


## Free Certification from Microsoft Ignite 2020

After finishing [Microsoft Ignite Cloud Skills Challenge 2020](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/microsoft-ignite-cloud-skills-challenge-2020-free-certification-exam) I got a free chance to participate AZ500 exam. Because I passed the Solutions Architect exam, which covers some security bits e.g. Azure AD (P1 and P2), RBAC and Security Center, I put more efforts on Sentinel which is relatively new to me. When I kicked off my test, I realized it's much harder than I expected. For instance, I didn't have experience on security hardening container images in ACR.
